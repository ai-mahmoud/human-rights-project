            <h2>A Common Standard of Achievement</h2>
            <p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a milestone document in the history of human rights.
                Drafted by representatives with different legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the world,
                the Declaration was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in Paris on 10 December 1948
                (General Assembly resolution 217 A) as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations.
            </p>
            <p>The drafting committee was chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt, widow of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. She
                played a pivotal role in navigating the complex political tensions of the time to reach a consensus.</p>

            <h2>Significance and Legacy</h2>
            <p>The UDHR is not a treaty, so it does not directly create legal obligations for countries. However, it is
                an expression of the fundamental values which are shared by all members of the international community.
                It has profoundly influenced the development of international human rights law.</p>
            <p>It holds the Guinness World Record as the most translated document in the world, available in over 500
                languages. Its principles have been incorporated into the constitutions of many newly independent
                nations and have inspired more than 80 international human rights treaties and declarations.</p>
