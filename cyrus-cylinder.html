            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>The Cyrus Cylinder is an ancient clay cylinder, now broken into several pieces, on which is written a
                declaration in Akkadian cuneiform script in the name of Persia's Achaemenid king Cyrus the Great. It
                dates from the 6th century BC and was discovered in the ruins of Babylon in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) in
                1879.</p>
            <p>In 539 BC, the armies of Cyrus the Great, the first king of ancient Persia, conquered the city of
                Babylon. But it was his next actions that marked a <strong>major advance for Man</strong>. He <strong>freed the slaves</strong>, declared
                that all people had the <strong>right to choose</strong> their own religion, and established racial <strong>equality</strong>.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Text</h2>
            <p>The text on the Cylinder praises Cyrus, sets out his genealogy, and portrays him as a king from a line of
                kings. It denounces the deposed Babylonian king Nabonidus as an oppressor of the people of Babylonia and
                his low-born origins are implicitly contrasted to Cyrus's kingly heritage.</p>
            <p class="quote">"I am Cyrus, King of the World, Great King, Mighty King, King of Babylon, King of Sumer and
                Akkad, King of the Four Quarters... When I entered Babylon as a friend and established the seat of
                government in the palace of the ruler under jubilation and rejoicing, Marduk, the great lord, induced
                the magnanimous inhabitants of Babylon to love me, and I was daily endeavoring to worship him... My vast
                troops were marching peaceably in Babylon, and the whole of Sumer and Akkad had nothing to fear."</p>
            <p>Crucially, it records that Cyrus allowed the peoples who had been deported to Babylon by previous kings
                to <strong>return to their homes and rebuild their temples</strong>. This included the <em>Jews</em>, who had been exiled in
                Babylon.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The "First Charter of Human Rights"</h2>
            <p>Known today as the Cyrus Cylinder, this ancient record has now been recognized as the <strong>world’s <em>first</em>
                charter</strong> of human rights.</p>
            <p>It is translated into all <strong>six</strong> official languages of the United Nations and its provisions parallel the
                <em>first four Articles</em> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. A replica of the Cylinder is kept at
                the United Nations Headquarters in New York, symbolizing the ancient roots of the modern <strong>struggle for
                human dignity</strong>.</p>
            <p>While some historians argue that the Cylinder fits into a long tradition of Mesopotamian royal
                propaganda, its modern interpretation as a <strong>symbol</strong> of <strong>tolerance and justice</strong> remains powerful and
                influential.</p>
