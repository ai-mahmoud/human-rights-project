            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>The Petition of Right is a major English constitutional document that sets out specific liberties of the
                subject that the king is prohibited from infringing. Passed on 7 June 1628, the Petition contains
                restrictions on non-parliamentary taxation, forced billeting of soldiers, imprisonment without cause,
                and the use of martial law.</p>
            <p>It was produced by the English Parliament in the run-up to the English Civil War. Following a series of
                disputes with King Charles I over finance and foreign policy, Parliament sought to curb the King's
                arbitrary use of power. The King had been forcing loans from his subjects and imprisoning those who
                refused to pay.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Four Grievances</h2>
            <p>The Petition cited the Magna Carta and other statutes to argue that the King had violated the rights of
                his subjects in four key areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Taxation:</strong> No taxes could be levied without Parliament's consent. This challenged
                    the King's "Divine Right" to rule as he saw fit.</li>
                <li><strong>Imprisonment:</strong> No subject could be imprisoned without a shown cause (reaffirming
                    <em>Habeas Corpus</em>). This was a direct response to the "Five Knights' Case" where men were
                    jailed for refusing the forced loan.</li>
                <li><strong>Billeting:</strong> No soldiers could be quartered upon the citizenry. This practice had
                    been used to intimidate the population.</li>
                <li><strong>Martial Law:</strong> Martial law could not be used in peacetime.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Significance</h2>
            <p>The Petition of Right is regarded as one of England's most famous constitutional documents, of equal
                value to Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights 1689. It asserted the supremacy of the law over the personal
                will of the monarch and was a crucial step in the development of constitutional monarchy and the
                protection of civil liberties.</p>
