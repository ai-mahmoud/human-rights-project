<ul>
    <li>
        The next recorded milestone in the development of human rights was the Petition of Right
        , produced in 1628 by the English Parliament and sent to Charles I as a statement of civil liberties.
    </li>
    <li>
       Refusal by Parliament to finance the king's unpopular foreign policy had caused his government
        to exact forced loans and to quarter troops in subjects' houses as an economy measure. 
    </li>
    <li>Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment for opposing these policies had produced in Parliament
         a violent hostility to Charles and to George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham. </li>
         <li>
            The Petition of Right, initiated by Sir Edward Coke, was based upon
             earlier statutes and charters and asserted four principles:
         </li>
</ul>
<h2>the four principles</h2>
<ol type="1">
    <li> No taxes may be levied without consent of Parliament. </li>
    <li>No subject may be imprisoned without cause shown (reaffirmation of the right of habeas corpus) </li>
    <li>No soldiers may be quartered upon the citizenry. </li>
    <li>Martial law may not be used in time of peace. </li>
