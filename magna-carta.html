            <h2>The Great Charter</h2>
            <p>Magna Carta Libertatum (Medieval Latin for "Great Charter of Freedoms"), commonly called <em>Magna Carta</em>, is
                a <strong>royal</strong> charter of rights agreed to by King John of England at Runnymede, near Windsor, on 15 June 1215.
                First drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury to make peace between the unpopular King and a group of
                rebel barons, it promised the <strong>protection</strong> of church rights, <strong>protection</strong> for the barons from <strong>illegal
                imprisonment</strong>, access to <strong>swift justice</strong>, and <strong>limitations</strong> on feudal payments to the Crown.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Key Principles</h2>
            <p>Among the rights established were:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The right of the church to be <strong>free</strong> from governmental interference.</li>
                <li>The rights of all free citizens to <strong>own and inherit</strong> property.</li>
                <li><strong>Protection</strong> from excessive taxes.</li>
                <li>Established the right of widows who owned property to <strong>choose</strong> not to remarry.</li>
                <li>Established principles of <strong>due process and equality</strong> before the law.</li>
                <li>It also contained provisions <strong>forbidding</strong> bribery and official misconduct.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="quote">"No free man shall be <strong>seized</strong> or <strong>imprisoned</strong>, or <strong>stripped</strong> of his rights or possessions, or
                <strong>outlawed</strong> or <strong>exiled</strong>, or <strong>deprived</strong> of his standing in any way, nor will we proceed with <strong>force</strong> against him,
                or send others to do so, except by the <strong>lawful judgment</strong> of his equals or by the law of the land." —
                Clause 39</p>
            <p class="quote">"To no one will we <strong>sell</strong>, to no one <strong>deny</strong> or <strong>delay</strong> right or justice." — Clause 40</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Magna Carta is considered one of the most <strong>important</strong> documents in the history of democracy. It influenced
                the early American colonists and the formation of the US Constitution. Lord Denning, a famous English
                judge, described it as "the <strong>greatest</strong> constitutional document of all times – the foundation of the
                <strong>freedom</strong> of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot."</p>
            <p>It was reissued several times in the 13th century and finally <strong>confirmed</strong> as part of English statute law in
                1297. While only three clauses remain in force in English law today, its symbolic power remains
                undiminished.</p>
