        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Human Rights Violations</h2>
            <p>Human rights advocates agree that, sixty years after its issue, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
                is still more a dream than reality. Violations exist in every part of the world.</p>
            <p>For example, Amnesty International’s 2009 World Report and other sources show that individuals are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tortured or abused in at least 81 countries</li>
                <li>Face unfair trials in at least 54 countries</li>
                <li>Restricted in their freedom of expression in at least 77 countries</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Not only that, but women and children in particular are marginalized in numerous ways, the press is not
                free in many countries, and dissenters are silenced, too often permanently. While some gains have been
                made over the course of the last six decades, human rights violations still plague the world today.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Examples of Violations</h2>

            <h3>Article 3 — The Right to Live Free</h3>
            <p class="quote">“Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.”</p>
            <p>An estimated 6,500 people were killed in 2007 in armed conflict in Afghanistan—nearly half being
                noncombatant civilian deaths at the hands of insurgents. Hundreds of civilians were also killed in
                suicide attacks by armed groups.</p>
            <p>In Brazil in 2007, according to official figures, police killed at least 1,260 individuals—the highest
                total to date. All incidents were officially labeled “acts of resistance” and received little or no
                investigation.</p>

            <h3>Article 5 — No Torture</h3>
            <p class="quote">“No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
                punishment.”</p>
            <p>In 2008, US authorities continued to hold 270 prisoners in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, without charge or trial,
                subjecting them to “water-boarding,” torture that simulates drowning. Former-President George W. Bush
                authorized the CIA to continue secret detention and interrogation, despite its violation of
                international law.</p>

            <h2>Anti-Corruption</h2>

            <h3>Definition of Corruption</h3>
            <p>International Transparency Organization defined corruption as “every act that involves misuse of public
                office to achieve a person's interest for himself or for his group.”</p>

            <h3>Types of Corruption</h3>
            <p>There are many types of corruption according to the nature of the corrupt act:</p>

            <h4>Administrative Corruption</h4>
            <p>Corruption is administrative if it relates to the abuse of power by executive authority employees.</p>

            <h4>Political Corruption</h4>
            <p>Corruption is political if it relates to the abuse of power and deviant practices issued by the political
                elite (such as senior government officials, ministers, leaders of political parties and senior
                legislative and judicial officials). Sometimes it is difficult to accurately differentiate between some
                forms of administrative and political corruption because of the overlapped reasons and the interaction
                between these two types that can be inseparable.</p>

            <h4>Social Corruption</h4>
            <p>Corruption is social if it is related to glitch in social values.</p>

            <h4>Moral Corruption</h4>
            <p>Corruption is moral if it relates to moral deviations and the individual's undisciplined behavior that is
                regulated by religion, traditions or acceptable social custom. Moral corruption is a form of social
                corruption as well.</p>

            <h4>Cultural Corruption</h4>
            <p>Corruption is cultural when any cultural group deviates from the general constants and seeks to dismantle
                its identity and characteristics, and compromises the positions of purgatory and chastity in its
                culture.</p>

            <h4>Financial Corruption</h4>
            <p>Corruption is financial if it relates to financial deviations and violation of the provisions and rules
                adopted in the state’s organizations and institutions, with violation of the provisions and rules
                adopted in the state’s organizations and institutions, with violation of the regulations and
                instructions of financial control. It is also a violation of the law by adopting illegal ways to achieve
                financial gains.</p>

            <p>The kinds of violations the employee commits in relation to financial aspects are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Violation of the financial rules and provisions stipulated in the applicable law and regulations.
                </li>
                <li>Violation of the provisions of tenders, auctions, stores and purchases.</li>
                <li>Negligence or failure that results in the loss or possible loss of a financial right of the state.
                </li>
                <li>Every intentional act that results in the disbursement of an amount of state funds or the loss of
                    its rights.</li>
                <li>Failure to provide the Central Auditing Organization with copies of contracts, agreements, tenders,
                    accounts and documents on time, or delay in responding to their contradictions.</li>
            </ul>
