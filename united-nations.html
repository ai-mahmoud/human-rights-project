            <h2>Formation and Purpose</h2>
            <p>The United Nations (UN) is an <strong>intergovernmental organization</strong> founded in 1945, in the aftermath of the
                <strong>Second World War</strong>. Its charter was drafted at a conference in San Francisco attended by representatives
                of <em>50</em> countries. The UN officially came into existence on October 24, 1945, when the Charter had been
                ratified by China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and by a majority of
                other signatories.</p>
            <p>The primary mandate of the UN is to maintain <em>international</em> <strong>peace and security</strong>, develop <strong>friendly relations</strong>
                among nations, achieve <em>international</em> <strong>cooperation</strong>, and be a centre for <strong>harmonizing</strong> the actions of
                nations. Central to this mission is the promotion and protection of human rights.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Human Rights Framework</h2>
            <p>The UN Charter was the <em>first</em> international treaty to explicitly <strong>mention</strong> the term human rights. The preamble
                reaffirms "faith in <strong>fundamental human rights</strong>, in the <strong>dignity</strong> and <strong>worth</strong> of the human person, in the <strong>equal
                rights</strong> of men and women and of nations large and small."</p>
            <p>To operationalize this commitment, the UN established the <strong>Commission on Human Rights</strong> in 1946 (replaced by
                the Human Rights Council in 2006). This body was tasked with drafting the International Bill of Human
                Rights, which includes the <a href="udhr.html"><strong>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</strong></a> (1948), the International Covenant on
                Civil and Political Rights (1966), and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
                Rights (1966).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Key Bodies & Agencies</h2>
            <p><strong>The General Assembly:</strong> The main deliberative body where all member states have <em>equal
                representation</em>. It adopts <strong>resolutions</strong> and <strong>declarations</strong> on human rights issues.</p>
            <p><strong>The Human Rights Council:</strong> An <em>inter-governmental</em> body within the United Nations system
                made up of 47 States responsible for the <strong>promotion</strong> and <strong>protection</strong> of all human rights around the globe.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR):</strong> The leading UN entity on human
                rights, representing the <strong>world's</strong> commitment to the <strong>promotion</strong> and <strong>protection</strong> of the full range of human
                rights and freedoms set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
            <p><strong>UNICEF & WHO:</strong> While not exclusively human rights bodies, agencies like UNICEF
                (Children's Fund) and WHO (World Health Organization) play a <em>critical</em> role in realizing the rights to
                health, education, and protection for vulnerable populations.</p>
