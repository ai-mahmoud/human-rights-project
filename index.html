            <h2>Definition of Human Rights</h2>
            <p>“The basic rights and freedoms to which all human beings are entitled, often held to include <strong>the right to
                life and liberty, freedom of thought and expression, and equality before the law</strong>”.</p>
            <p>Rights are things to which you are entitled or allowed; freedoms that are <strong>guaranteed</strong>. If you were to ask people in the street, “What are human rights?” you would get many different answers.
            They would tell you the rights they know about, but very few people know <strong>all</strong> their rights.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Principle of Respect</h2>
            <p>Human rights are based on the principle of respect for the individual. Their fundamental assumption is
                that each person is a <strong>moral and rational being</strong> who deserves to be treated with dignity.
                They are called <strong><em>human rights</em></strong> because they are universal.
                Whereas nations or specialized groups enjoy specific rights that apply only to them,
                human rights apply to <strong>everyone</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Scope of Human Rights</h2>
            <p>The full scope of human rights is very broad. They mean <strong>choice and opportunity</strong>.
                They mean the <strong>freedom</strong> to obtain a job, adopt a career,
                select a partner of one’s choice and raise children. They include the
                <strong>right to travel</strong> widely and the right to work gainfully <strong>without</strong> harassment, abuse and threat of arbitrary
                dismissal. They even embrace the right to <strong>leisure</strong>.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, human rights are the <strong>basis</strong> of everything people cherish about their way of life.
            Long before the term “human rights” came into existence, men and women <strong>struggled, fought and died</strong>
            for these
                principles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is <strong>the world’s <em>premier</em> human rights instrument</strong>. Its opening
                paragraph is a powerful <strong>affirmation</strong> of the principles that lie at the heart
                of the modern human rights system: “<strong>Recognition</strong> of the <strong>inherent</strong> dignity
                and of the <strong>equal and inalienable</strong> rights of all members of
                the human family is the foundation of <strong>freedom, justice and peace</strong> in the world.”</p>
            <p>Yet a <strong>wide <em>gap</em></strong> exists between the articulation of these
            goals and their accomplishment. <strong>Millions</strong> are not
                free. Justice is often <strong>inequitable</strong>. And peace continues to elude many regions of the world.
                Bridging the enormous gulf between the ideal of universal human rights and the
                reality of widespread human rights
                violations is the challenge that <em>drives human rights advocates</em>.</p>
